# supu.io : docs : roadmap

[< Return to index](README.md)

This is the roadmap document for the *supu.io* project. It describes the
remaining work to do.

It is a live document, it means that changes on this spec are and will be
comming if it is necessary. Nothing is fixed or closed unless we excplicity say
the contrary. So please put everything in doubt and keep the discussion
alive ;)

This document follows an idea started by Ubuntu, which consists in planning a
great but difficult bug 0 (our 1.0 version) to solve, so all minor versions &
milestones should refer this one and solve an small task and part of it.

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward
compatibility, all project components are maintained under
[the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw
up, but we'll adhere to those rules whenever is possible.

We also follow the rule that one issue fixed should be a new minor release, so
expect to have a lot of minor version numbers changes, this will be normal.

## 1.0
